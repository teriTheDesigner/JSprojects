# Simple Calculator Project

This project is a simple calculator. You can take it as inspiration to create your own. Follow these few steps:

1. **Sketch a Layout**: Sketch a layout of the calculator so you have an idea of which buttons you need and how you can style them.

2. **Define Button Values**: Decide how you want to define the value for each button. I like to use data attributes in HTML. In this project, I am using `data-value="7"` so I can easily access the value in JavaScript.

3. **Access DOM Elements**: Access the DOM elements in your JavaScript file.

4. **Add Event Listeners**: Add an event listener to every button and get its value on click.

5. **Create Functions**: Create functions to perform relevant actions on click.

6. **Calculate User Input**: Use `eval()` to calculate the user's input (note: using `eval()` has security risks and should be avoided in production code).

7. **Error Handling**: Consider how you would like to check for errors in case of invalid calculations.
